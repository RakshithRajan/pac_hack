[Redacted]

[Redacted], [Redacted], and LLaMA are not suitable for offline 
redaction tools like "RE-DACT" due to their large size 
and high computational requirements, which demand 
significant hardware resources. Additionally, their 
substantial memory and storage needs make them 
impractical for local deployment. Ensuring data 
security and not storing sensitive data can be 
problematic with these models, as managing and 
securing such large models locally poses significant 
challenges.
We have to make our own customized model using 
spaCy as base along with other models.
[Redacted] by [Redacted] is a powerful tool designed for the detection and redaction 
of [Redacted] ([Redacted]). Here’s how it could be helpful for your 
project:
What it Does:
[Redacted] is an open-source solution specifically built to identify and redact 
sensitive information from text. It can recognize and handle various types of [Redacted], 
including phone numbers, email addresses, [Redacted] (SSNs), and 
other confidential data.
[Redacted]:
Highly Customizable: You can tailor [Redacted] to meet your specific needs by 
configuring its built-in detectors or adding custom ones. This flexibility allows 
[Redacted]

it to adapt to different data types and formats.
Offline Capability: Unlike cloud-based models, [Redacted] operates offline, 
making it suitable for environments where data privacy is a concern, as it does 
not require internet access for processing.
Integration with spaCy: Presidio works seamlessly with spaCy, a popular [Redacted] 
library, enhancing its text analysis capabilities and enabling more 
sophisticated [Redacted] detection.
[Redacted]:
Limited Scope: While [Redacted] is effective at detecting predefined types of [Redacted], 
its built-in capabilities may not cover all sensitive information unless extended. 
Custom recognizers can be added, but this requires additional development 
effort.
[Redacted]’s offline functionality and customizable nature make it a strong candidate 
for integrating into tools like “RE-DACT,” where control over data processing and 
privacy is paramount.

Since all 3 of these are completely different tasks we 
can have three different options for the user to use 
before working on the document along with selecting 
the intensity of redacting.. 
Redaction: Users can select this option to permanently remove or obscure 
sensitive information from the data, leaving a blank or placeholder. This is 
ideal for scenarios where the original data should not be recoverable.
Anonymization: This option will modify the data to protect personal identifiers 
while retaining the overall data structure and format. It’s useful for data sharing
or analysis where preserving the context is important without revealing 
individual identities.
Masking: Users can opt for masking to replace sensitive data with a 
predefined mask or pattern, such as [Redacted] or asterisks. This approach allows for 
[Redacted]

the sensitive data to be hidden while still maintaining its structure for testing or 
other purposes.

We will have to train domain specific (for [Redacted], health 
care related) for them to be more precise and accurate 
and for data generation we can regression 
expressions.
Since the Domain Bucket is “Blockchain and 
Cybersecurity”.. maybe we should pay a bit more 
attention to it like integrating blockchain technology to

create a secure and immutable record of the redaction 
process. This ensures data integrity and provides a 
transparent log of what data was redacted, by whom, 
and when.
Customizable Redaction Templates
Allow users to create and save customizable redaction templates based on their 
specific needs. These templates could include predefined rules for different types 
of sensitive data, making the redaction process faster and more tailored.
[Redacted]
Introduce adaptive redaction levels based on the sensitivity of the data. For 
example, a feature that uses [Redacted] to suggest appropriate redaction levels based on 
the content's sensitivity, user intent, or regulatory requirements.
[Redacted] Assistant
Create an interactive assistant that guides users through the redaction process, 
offering real-time suggestions and visual feedback. This could use a combination 
of [Redacted] and [Redacted] elements to help users quickly and accurately redact information.
